# eote-gear
A custom utility to let our Star Wars tabletop group search through inventory and gear management more granularly than the existing tools we have.

#### Edge of the Empire Gear Management site/application
A unified space that allows for the browsing, examination, research and reference for every piece of Equipment (Weapons, Armor, Gear) in the game
#### Ideal Features
* Large interface allowing for simultaneous comparison of multiple items
 * A Search Bar that searches through ALL columns (Name, Qualities, Categories, Description, EVERYTHING)
 * Most important feature!! Table framework used MUST support Search Bar of some sort. Without this feature, there’s not a whole lot of point to the app, as the existing Equipment page in the Character Generator, does 98% of the same functionality I’m already replicating.
